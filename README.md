# EcoSort

# This is my 10th grade Project for the Coriell Science Fair this year.

Waste management is a critical global challenge, necessitating innovative solutions to efficiently categorize and process different types of waste. This project presents a comprehensive waste segregation system employing the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 classification model. The primary objectives of the project are to accurately identify and classify waste into three distinct categories: e-waste, recyclable waste, and trash. The YOLOv8 model is used for its real-time object detection capabilities, enabling swift and precise recognition of objects within images and video frames. Training data comprised a diverse dataset encompassing various waste items, ensuring robust model generalization. The model was fine-tuned to specifically recognize e-waste, recyclables, and general trash items, enhancing its applicability to practical waste segregation scenarios.

Edit 3/17/2024: I Just won First Place in the Computer Science division at the Coriell Science Fair. I am moving on to the DVSF competition.
Edit 4/27/2024: A bit late, but didn't move on. I did present EcoSort on 3/18/2024 at the NJ STEM Showcase in front of legislators.

Edit 12/1/2025: I was looking at all my repos and saw this doesnt have the code. I looked for it on my mac but turns out its on my windows laptop. In the meantime, heres a vid of me running it (ish)
